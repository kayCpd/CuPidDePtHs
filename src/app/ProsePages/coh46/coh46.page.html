        <h4>(Cockpit Of Hell)</h4> 
        <p>You might as well..
          Cock a gun..
          To your head..
          In order to die!

        <p>You might as well..
            Cross a T junction..
            When the red light is on..
            To go to the great beyond!

        <p>A smack..
            A mark..
            A maim..
            As you swim!

        <p>His waters are dangerous..
            Crocodile thrashings and rollings..
            Piranha hugs & crushes..
            Tiger sharks’ amputations! 

        <p>Who are you hanging with?
            Wanna get hanged?
            Hey, you better watch it..
            Doomsday is nigh!

        <p>If only you knew..
            If only you could see..
            Then you would run..
            Flee for dear life!

        <p>He is merely interested,
            in using you..
            You are a pun,
            in his chess game!

        <p>You are no cheese..
            You are no honey..
            You are expendable..
            In his eyes!

        <p>Don’t open your eyes..    
            Ogling at falling trees from above..
            If you don’t want to go blind, the elders say!

        <p>Alas.. You are not listening..
            You are romancing the stone..
            A gutless loveless being..
            Is the object of your fantasy!

        <p>He cannot love..
            He cannot care..
            He is an emotional sadist..
            A romantic psychopath to the core!

        <p>Flee like a bird from him..
            Be free as the wind..
            You are better off..
            Don’t commit emotional suicide!
      </p>
