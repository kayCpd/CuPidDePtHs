        <h4>(The Fool And His Money)</h4>
        <p>To my love..
          I am all open..
          Give it to me,
          she screams at him!

        <p>Phone in her left hand..
            She speaks to her other lover..
            O my love.. I miss you..
            Miss you to bits!

        <p>What the hell! The man on top screams..
            Who are you talking to?
            Put your mind on the job..
            Give it to me real good baby!

        <p>Then, play on Prince charming..
            Let me pacify this guy..
            After all, he provided the money
            for this lovely hotel!

        <p>Okay, in that case..
            Speak nicely to him..
            Cuddle him with sweet words..
            As I keep pounding!
      </p>
