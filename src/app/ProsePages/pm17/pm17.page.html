        <h4>(Percious Moment)</h4>
        <p>Quiet night with crickets chirping;
          Hey there, what are they doing?
          Must the night just pass them by?
       
        <p>The lovers need to be together!
          Do they want to waste this night?
          Will they rather ignore the vibes?
          
       <p>The Chrysanthemums have slept
          the Sunflowers are in slumberland!
          Not the Queen of the night
          she woos all with sensitive nostrils
          intensely erotic is her aroma
          captivating is her sweetness!

       <p>“Come my love”.. he says to her
          the night is calling..
          Even the moon is crawling,
          calling us to cuddle!

       <p>“Methinks I will surrender”.. she replies and continues:
          “I’ll not fight this feeling anymore,
          no no; only me heart feels the pain
          as I struggle with my inner being”!

       <p>Where would you rather be..
          Where the river bed is calm?
          Or where the waves of the sea
          have decided to rest for the night!

       <p>Alas there souls are weary..
          The very depths of their beings
          wants an amalgamation;
          A cohesion of his soul with hers!
      </p>
