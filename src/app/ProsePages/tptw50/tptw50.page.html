        <h4>(The Past.. The Whip!)</h4> 
        <p>Caught up by emotions..
          Overwrought by the past..
          You often think..
          And continue to think!

        <p>Hey.. You’ve got to move on..
            You don’t win a race,
            by looking at your rear..
            You must push on!

        <p>Don’t be pushed behind..
            By bad reminiscences..
            Thoughts of what should..
            Or shouldn’t have happened!

        <p>It is done..
            You cannot undo them..
            Let them be..
            Keep moving on!

        <p>When one door closes..
            Leave it closed..
            Open your eyes..
            It’s a brand new day!

        <p>You cannot change the past..
            You cannot rewrite it..
            Learn from it..
            Don’t yearn for it!

        <p>Bear the heat..
            It’s gonna be for a while..
            But time heals..
            Better days are coming!

        <p>Time and again in nature..
            A seed falls to the ground..
            Disintegrates and eventually sprouts..
            To give birth to a new plant! 

        <p>The plant grows..
            Gets nurtured by nature..
            Flowers bloom..
            And new fruits emerge!
      </p>
