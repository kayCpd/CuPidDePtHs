  <h4>In classical mythology...</h4>
  <p>Cupid is the god of desire, erotic love, attraction and affection.
    His symbol consists of a bow and arrow.
  </p>
  <p>Various artists have attested that oftentimes;
    Cupid shoots his arrow so fast that it is very difficult to avoid being smitten..
  </p>

  <p>
    This is usually followed by different manifestations in the erotic love zone.
    Some of his victims (oftentimes winners; I dare say!) may find themselves in “misty blue pleasant situations”,
    “quagmires” , “erotic adventures” etc.
    <br>
    <br>Cupid’s depthis a compilation of 50 prose pieces depicting different levels and depth of these manifestations.

  Thank you. Please enjoy!
