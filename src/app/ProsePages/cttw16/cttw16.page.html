        <h4>(Caution to the Winds)</h4> 
        <p>Everything flew out of the windows, 
          they were like children
          with parched throats.
          
      <p>On a hot summer afternoon
          with the dry scorching winds 
          and beads of sweat 
          running down their faces.
          
          Mum’s didn’t like it
          but their lips ravished the salty taste,
          as the sweat entered their mouths!

      <p> Like ice cream
          garnished  with currants and chocolate slabs
          deeply immersed,
          they savoured it all.

          My o My
          no holds barred,
          they let it all go
          before you could say
          "hold" on or "presto"!

      <p> They had crossed the bridge,
          there was no going back.
          The alluring attraction
          was immensely great..
          Pleasure & Passion prevailed!

      <p>Moaning till the morning,
          even the Mona Lisa painting
          on the wall looked brighter.
          Was it an imagination?
          who cares? It may be cupid’s rays!

      <p> Deeply they wished
          they could go on and on.
          Time went by,
          but not their feelings,
          not the depth of this intimacy!
      </p>
