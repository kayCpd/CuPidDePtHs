        <h4>(Beasts Of Romance)</h4> 
        <p>Clouds blown away by awry wind..
          Promising much but producing nothing..
          Empty vessels making a lot of noise..
          Howling like Jackals in the desert!

        <p>Parched throats of evil..
            Gluttons who can’t ever be satisfied..
            Behaving like wild ruminants..
            Intermittently regurgitating evil and deceit!

        <p>Winds against good souls..
            Evil personified and ills magnified..
            Revelling in destruction..
            Basking in the heat of doom!

        <p>Crying wolf for self aggrandisement..
            Deceiving unsuspecting partners..
            Inventing non existing problems..
            Extortionists to the core!

        <p>Wanton emotional destroyers..
            Teutonically efficient bulldozers..
            Exterminating other people’s joy..
            Leaving them dejected and hapless!

        <p>Creating cataclysmic chasms..
            Whereby partners are deceived..
            Confused and gobbersmacked..
            As they cohabit with Chameleons!

        <p>They cannot be understood..
            They are hybrids of creation..
            Cross between animals and man..
            Beasts to the hilt!

        <p>This is no Hilton Hotel..
            They are hills of sadness..
            A far cry from paradisiacal Joy..
            Lilies interspaced with poison Ivy!

        <p>Tarantulas weaving webs..
            To wallop unsuspecting victims..
            With potent and swift venom..
            Swirling them into shallow graves!

        <p>Dried up wells of compassion..
            Doomsday perpetrators..
            Pipedream creators..
            Blackest darkness daredevils!
      </p>
