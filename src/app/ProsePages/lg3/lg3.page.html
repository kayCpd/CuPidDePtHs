        <h4>(Let Go)</h4> 
  <p>Don’t take the bait,
      you are not salmon..
      You are not cheap prey
      in the food chain!

      So she wants to go..
      But you still care deeply,
      hey.! Let her go.. Rather than loathe you..
      Let her follow her rainbow.
  
  <p>There are no two snowflakes alike,
      No two raindrops alike..
      Even identical twins aren’t the same weight,
      This is life’s stark reality!

   <p>You are two different stars
      In the starry skies of life.
      Yes; you both shine..
      But your orbits and domains are different!

  <p>If she stays,
      nagging and resentment
      shall be your main menu..
      Hatred and frustration your dessert!

   <p>Hey.. develop your inner self..
      Find out whom you are..
      Hone your skills..
      Develop your talents..
      
  <p>Be creative, not wait to be cremated..
      Creation in nature has made you creative.
      Give life as long as you live..
      Bring Innovation to birth and nurture it!

   <p>Time and again,
      you may not see well
      until some human veil disappears..
      Then your vision becomes as sharp as an Eagle’s!

  <p>Some doors need to close,
      for newer, fresher and better ones..
      To stay ajar and open..
      Bringing ceaseless blessings!

  <p>Then you’ll look back,
      with a sigh of relief..
      You blow out hot air,
      cooly & calmly you smile.. For it’s a bright day!
  </p>
